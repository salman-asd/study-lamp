 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * FACEBOOK: WHEN THE GRAPH API IS ACTUALLY NEEDED
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Facebook video support intentionally mirrors the YouTube integration's
 * shape (a public, no-auth mechanism where one exists; the Graph API only
 * where Facebook requires it), but the split lands in a different place:
 *
 *   1. Resolving a short share link (fb.watch/xxxx, /share/v/xxxx/) to its
 *      canonical, ID-bearing URL — a PUBLIC mechanism. It's just following
 *      an HTTP redirect, same as any short link. No Graph API, no token.
 *
 *   2. Playing a public video in-app — a PUBLIC mechanism. Facebook's
 *      "plugins/video.php" iframe embed works for any public video URL
 *      with zero auth (see providers.ts embedUrl()), exactly like the
 *      YouTube iframe embed.
 *
 *   3. Fetching metadata for a pasted video URL — the *lookup* is a PUBLIC
 *      mechanism as of 15 June 2026 (Meta made `/oembed_video` tokenless,
 *      no App Review needed), but as of 3 Nov 2025 Meta permanently
 *      removed `thumbnail_url`, `author_name`, `author_url`, and the
 *      thumbnail dimension fields from what oEmbed returns at all — for
 *      every caller, tokened or not. That's not a config problem on our
 *      end; there's no request shape that brings those fields back. Per
 *      Meta's own migration guidance, title/thumbnail now come from
 *      reading Open Graph tags (`og:title`, `og:image`) directly off the
 *      public video page's HTML instead — see
 *      fetchFacebookOpenGraphTags's doc comment. oEmbed is still used
 *      alongside that for the `html` embed fragment, which it does still
 *      provide. fetchFacebookVideoOEmbed still checks oEmbed's own
 *      `thumbnail_url`/`title` fields first, defensively, in case that
 *      removal doesn't hold for every URL shape or account — see its doc
 *      comment for the full fallback order.
 *
 *   4. Listing the videos inside a Facebook "collection" (a Page's Video
 *      Library playlist / video_list) — still REQUIRES the Graph API with
 *      a Page access token. oEmbed is a single-URL-in, single-embed-out
 *      contract (per Meta's own migration notes) — there's no oEmbed edge
 *      for "give me every video in this list", same as there's no way to
 *      scrape a YouTube playlist without the Data API. This is the
 *      Facebook analogue of YOUTUBE_API_KEY + playlist.ts's
 *      YouTubePlaylistProvider, and the tokenless change above doesn't
 *      touch it.
 *
 * All of this only ever runs on the server (API routes under
 * src/app/api/facebook-*), the same way YOUTUBE_API_KEY never reaches the
 * browser in youtubeDuration.ts / playlist.ts.

/**
 * Calls the Graph API's oEmbed Video endpoint for the `html` embed
 * fragment (tokenless since Meta's 15 June 2026 change — see module doc,
 * case 3), then separately reads Open Graph tags off the public page for
 * title/thumbnail, because oEmbed's own JSON fields no longer carry that
 * data — see fetchFacebookOpenGraphTags's doc comment for why. `ogPageUrl`
 * is the URL to scrape for those tags; pass the plain canonical
 * `/watch/?v=` (or original `/reel/`) URL here, since — unlike
 * oEmbedVideoUrl — this fetch isn't sensitive to which Facebook URL shape
 * you use.
 *
 * Title/author priority: og:title/og:image (richest source, but
 * unofficial scraping — see fetchFacebookOpenGraphTags) → the caption/
 * author text embedded in oEmbed's own fallback `html` (official,
 * already-fetched, just underused) → oEmbed's JSON title field (rarely
 * populated for Facebook video/Reel posts, kept as a last resort). Every
 * one of those raw text sources gets run through parseFacebookTitleText,
 * since Facebook's "354K views · 4.3K reactions | Actual Title | Page
 * Name" three-segment shape (see its doc comment) can show up in any of
 * them, not just one. authorName prefers oEmbed's own `author_name` field
 * and the fallback html's "Posted by" text (both explicit, structured
 * author fields) over a title's trailing pageName segment (an inferred
 * guess); pageName is only used when nothing more explicit was found.
 *
 * The returned `title` is then `"<cleaned title> | <authorName>"` — the
 * requested display format — when an author was resolved, or just the
 * cleaned title when it wasn't; never a bare "Untitled video" when an
 * author is known, and never a trailing "| " with nothing after it.
 *
 * Thumbnail priority: oEmbed's own `thumbnail_url` field, in case Meta's
 * removal of that field (see module doc, case 3) doesn't apply to every
 * URL shape or gets reversed → og:image from the page scrape. Both are
 * run through sanitizeFacebookThumbnailUrl so a Facebook webpage URL
 * never ends up saved as a "thumbnail". There's no further unauthenticated
 * Graph API fallback for a single arbitrary video URL beyond these two —
 * the Graph API's richer image fields need either a User/Page access
 * token scoped to that content or the video's own object id, neither of
 * which is available from just a pasted public URL (contrast
 * fetchFacebookCollection below, which *does* have a Page token and a
 * real object id to query `picture` from).
 *
 * Returns null (never throws) only when every source fails entirely, so
 * callers can fall back to the same manual-entry UX already used for
 * other unfetchable metadata; a partial result (e.g. html but no title)
 * is still returned since "Untitled video" + a working embed is more
 * useful than nothing.
