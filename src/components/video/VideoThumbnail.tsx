/**
 * The one video-thumbnail component.
 *
 * Every surface that shows a video thumbnail should use this — grid cards,
 * list rows, the playlist sidebar, the "up next" list, and the dashboard.
 * Two things kept drifting when each surface did its own <Image>:
 *
 *   1. Watch-progress indicator. VideoCard drew a bar *on* the thumbnail,
 *      ContinueWatchingCard drew one *below* it, PlaylistVideoRow drew one,
 *      and VideoListRow (Watch Later / Priority) drew none at all. So the same
 *      partially-watched video looked different depending on which page you
 *      were on.
 *   2. Broken-thumbnail handling. Every one of them rendered <Image> directly,
 *      so a dead YouTube URL, a deleted personal upload, or a thumbnail that
 *      simply never got scraped produced the browser's broken-image glyph on
 *      a background-coloured box — or, with next/image, an error that could
 *      blank the whole card.
 *
 * Standardizing on ONE treatment (the thin bar across the bottom of the
 * thumbnail, which VideoCard already used) plus one fallback makes both
 * impossible to reintroduce per-surface.
